           <h2>Claude Elwood Shannon: American mathematician, electrical engineer, computer scientist, cryptographer and inventor </h2>

           <section>
             <h2>Early Life</h2>
             <ul class="life">
               <li><span class="bold" >1916</span> - Claude Shannon was born on April 30, 1916, in Petoskey, Michigan, USA, to a family that encouraged intellectual curiosity</li>
               <li><span class="bold" >1936</span> -  Attended University of Michigan, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering </li>
               <li><span class="bold" >1940</span> - Attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He completed his master’s degree in electrical engineering.His thesis, titled “A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits”, showed how Boolean algebra could be used to design electrical circuits, making use of binary logic for the first time.</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Career</h2>
             <ul  class="life">
               <li><span class="bold" >world-war II</span> - Shannon worked for the National Security Agency (NSA),where he played a crucial role in cryptography, the art of code-breaking and secure communications. His work at the NSA, though classified at the time, laid the groundwork for many of the techniques used in modern cryptography.</li>
               <li><span class="bold" >1948</span> - After the war, Shannon joined Bell Telephone Laboratories (later part of AT&T), where he worked as a researcher and contributed to the development of several key technologies.He wrote the  "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"This is perhaps Shannon’s most famous work, published in the Bell System Technical Journal. In this paper, Shannon laid out the fundamental principles of information theory, introducing concepts such as entropy, data compression, and the bit as a unit of information. This paper provided the mathematical framework for digital communication and is still the foundation for much of modern communications theory.</li>
               <li><span class="bold" >Post-Bell Labs</span> - Shannon became a professor at MIT, where he continued to make substantial contributions to both theoretical and applied aspects of engineering and mathematics. He continued to collaborate on the development of various communication technologies and even worked on projects such as artificial intelligence.</li>   
             </ul>

             <h2>Achievements</h2>
             <ul  class="life">
               <li><span class="bold" >Foundation of Information Theory</span> - His concept of entropy, which measures the uncertainty or information content in a message, is a key concept in both data compression and cryptography.</li>
               <li><span class="bold" >Shannon’s Mathematical Theory of Communication</span> - Shannon introduced the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which defines the capacity of a communication channel and helps quantify the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a noisy channel</li>
               <li><span class="bold" >Cryptography</span> - Shannon’s work on cryptography was highly influential in the development of secure communications. His "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" paper introduced the concept of unbreakable encryption using a random key (the one-time pad), a concept that is still used in modern cryptographic systems</li>
               <li><span class="bold">Recognition and Awards</span> - Shannon received numerous accolades throughout his career, including the National Medal of Science (1966) and the Turing Award (1972), which is often regarded as the Nobel Prize of computer science.He was also a member of several prestigious academies, including the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

               <h2>Legacy and Later Life</h2>
               <note>He was married to "Betty Shannon (m. 1949–2001)" and they had three children.After retiring from MIT in the 1970s, Shannon lived a quieter life, though he continued to be involved in some projects. He was also known for his love of puzzles, chess, and mechanical toys, reflecting his inventive nature. He passed away on February 24, 2001, at the age of 84.
<span>Shannon’s legacy lives on in the digital age. His theories and innovations laid the foundation for the modern information society, affecting everything from telecommunications and computer networking to data compression, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. His work continues to influence the development of technologies such as the internet, mobile communications, and cloud computing, making him one of the most important figures in the history of modern science and engineering.</span>
